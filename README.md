Pysics Simulations and explorations

Three body problem:
  - Famous Newtonian chaotic system simulation
  - Highly unstable system, change parameters with caution

    
Digital signal processing:
  - Low pass and band pass filter simulations
  - Anti aliasing analysis
  - Fourier components editting
  - Plots of signals and spectrums
